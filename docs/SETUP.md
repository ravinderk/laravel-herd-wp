# Installation & Setup Guide

Choose the installation method that best fits your needs and workflow.

## ðŸŽ¯ Choose Your Installation Method

### Option 1: Complete Repository (Recommended)
Best for users who want all features.

Copy all content of this repository to Herd root directory.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/herd-wordpress-scripts.git ~/Herd
```

After installation, your structure will look like:

```
~/Herd/                    # Repository root
â”œâ”€â”€ wp.new                 # Site creation script
â”œâ”€â”€ wp.delete              # Site deletion script  
â”œâ”€â”€ herd.xdebug           # Xdebug management
â”œâ”€â”€ herd.php              # PHP settings
â”œâ”€â”€ wp.php                # WordPress tools
â”œâ”€â”€ help                  # Command reference
â”œâ”€â”€ docs/                 # Documentation
â”œâ”€â”€ .php-error-template   # Error template
â”œâ”€â”€ your-site-1/          # Your WordPress sites
â”œâ”€â”€ your-site-2/          # (created by wp.new)
â””â”€â”€ your-site-3/
```

Keeping Scripts Updated, on latest release take latest pull.

```bash
cd ~/Herd
git pull origin main
```

### Option 2: Individual Scripts
Best for users who only need specific functionality.

Check our [Commands Overview](commands/COMMANDS.md) to see all available scripts and their purposes.

After installation, your structure will look like:
```
~/Herd/                    # Your existing Herd directory
â”œâ”€â”€ wp.new                 # Downloaded scripts
â”œâ”€â”€ your-existing-sites/  # Your existing projects
â””â”€â”€ your-new-wp-sites/    # New WordPress sites
```

Keeping Scripts Updated, re-download updated scripts as needed using the download links.
