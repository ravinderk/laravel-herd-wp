# Contributing Guidelines

## About This Project

These WordPress site management scripts were created for **personal use** to streamline local development with Laravel Herd. While I'm happy to share them with the community, please understand that this is a personal project maintained in my spare time.

## Getting Help

If you're experiencing issues or have questions:

1. **Check the README** - Most common issues are covered in the troubleshooting section
2. **Search existing issues** - Someone might have already encountered your problem
3. **Create a new issue** - If you can't find a solution, feel free to open an issue

## Making Changes

Since this is a personal project tailored to my specific workflow, I may not be able to accommodate all feature requests or changes. However, I encourage you to:

### Fork the Project

The best way to customize these scripts for your needs is to **fork this repository**:

1. Click the "Fork" button on GitHub
2. Clone your fork: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/repo-name.git`
3. Make your changes
4. Use your customized version

### Contributing Back

If you've made improvements that you think would benefit others:

1. **Fork the repository**
2. **Create a feature branch**: `git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`
3. **Make your changes** with clear, descriptive commits
4. **Test thoroughly** on your local setup
5. **Submit a pull request** with:
   - Clear description of what you've changed
   - Why the change is beneficial
   - Any potential breaking changes

## What I'm Looking For

I'm most likely to accept contributions that:

- ‚úÖ Fix bugs or security issues
- ‚úÖ Improve error handling
- ‚úÖ Add better documentation
- ‚úÖ Enhance compatibility with different setups
- ‚úÖ Improve the user experience

I'm less likely to accept:

- ‚ùå Major architectural changes
- ‚ùå Features that add significant complexity
- ‚ùå Changes that break existing functionality
- ‚ùå Platform-specific features (these scripts are designed for macOS + Herd)

## Code Style

Please maintain the existing code style:

- Use clear, descriptive variable names
- Add comments for complex logic
- Include emoji in echo statements for consistency
- Test all changes thoroughly

## Testing

Before submitting any changes:

1. Test the creation script with various configurations
2. Test the deletion script with different site setups
3. Ensure scripts work with both empty and non-empty database passwords
4. Verify error handling works correctly

## License
